1. Journal Prompt: Technology and March Madness
Write two paragraphs considering the following:

“March Madness, the annual NCAA basketball tournament, has increasingly integrated advanced technologies to enhance both gameplay and the fan experience. From the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting game outcomes to the implementation of augmented reality (AR) in broadcasting, technology is reshaping how we engage with sports. Reflect on how these technological advancements have influenced your perception of the tournament. Do you believe AI-driven predictions, such as those attempting to create perfect brackets, add excitement or detract from the unpredictability that makes March Madness thrilling? Additionally, consider the role of social media platforms and streaming services in transforming fan engagement during the tournament. How do these changes impact the traditional viewing experience and your connection to the games?”

March Madness is the annual NCAA Division I men's and women's basketball tournament, featuring 68 teams competing in a single-elimination format ￼. The tournament, also known as the Big Dance, has become one of the most popular sporting events in the US, known for its exciting upsets and Cinderella stories. The men's tournament was first held in 1939, while the women's tournament began in 1982.

The tournament is divided into several rounds, including the First Four, Round of 64, Round of 32, Sweet 16, Elite Eight, Final Four, and the National Championship game ￼.

Journal Prompt: AI & Test Prep
Write two paragraphs considering the following:

Recently, a school in Austin, Texas used AI tutors to help students prepare for tests—and it worked. Their scores improved so much that they ranked in the top 2% nationally.

Weekly Journal Prompt
Florida has enacted laws banning student cell phone use throughout the school day and restricting access to social media on school networks. Supporters argue these measures reduce distractions and cyberbullying, while opponents raise concerns about emergency communication and student autonomy. Read about Florida’s new legislation banning student cell phone use during the entire school day and restricting access to social media on school Wi-Fi:

Cell phones shouldn't be banned at schools because they can serve as valuable educational tools. With internet access, students can quickly look up information, access digital textbooks, and utilize educational apps that enhance learning. Mobile devices can also facilitate organization and time management, helping students stay on top of assignments and deadlines. By leveraging cell phones in a responsible manner, schools can create a more dynamic and interactive learning environment.

Moreover, a blanket ban on cell phones can be unrealistic and counterproductive. Many students rely on their phones for communication with parents, especially in emergency situations. By allowing cell phones in schools with clear guidelines, educators can teach students about digital responsibility, self-regulation, and etiquette. This approach prepares students for a world where mobile technology is increasingly integral to daily life, helping them develop essential skills for the digital age

Journal: "The Chromebook Challenge" - Why Safety and Ethics Matter
Recently, a dangerous trend called the “Chromebook Challenge” has been circulating online. This involves inserting objects like pencils into USB ports, which can cause fires or destroy the device. As a digital citizen and future tech professional, how should we respond to trends that put people and property at risk? What responsibilities do we have when using school technology? How would you explain the real-world consequences of this behavior to someone who thinks it’s “just a joke”?

Write two paragraphs exploring this topic, and be sure to include:

A clear claim about whether this trend is ethical or not.
Evidence or examples (from the letter, your experiences, or what you’ve learned in class).
Reasoning about why safety and responsible tech use matter.
